## Introduction and Definitions {#intro .unnumbered}

\[Insert general explanation of policy governance, explaining that we have adopted the outlook, if not the terminology, if policy governance.\] Define "policy," "regulation," and a other important terms.

## Section 1: Board of Education {#section-1-board-of-education}

### Policy 1.1: Policies {#policy-1.1-policies}

a) #### Policy Manual {#policy-1.1.a-policy-manual}

   All Policies will be codified in this Manual, and all policies included in this Manual will be diligently observed unless and until amended. The Policy Manual will be posted on the CSD website; and a bound, up-to-date, copy will be provided to each Board Member for use at each Meeting.

b) #### Procedure {#policy-1.1.b-procedure}

   The Board may use any procedure it deems appropriate to adopt and amend Policies, depending on the circumstances at hand. The level of outreach will be commensurate with the importance of and public interest in the subject matter, but the following procedures will ordinarily be observed:

   1) The need for a new policy will first be discussed at a Meeting or Work Session. At that time, or at a subsequent meeting, the Board will develop and a Policy Review Plan to be followed in developing the policy.

   2) If any applicable state or federal requirement is potentially implicated by the proposed change, the Policy Review Plan will provide for legal constraints to be identified early in the process and for any final recommendation to be reviewed for compliance before it is presented to the Board for approval.

   3) In most cases, the Policy Review Plan will call for the actual proposed language of any policy change to be posted on the CSD website, together with a brief explanation of its purpose, an invitation to interested persons comment on the proposal, and instructions for doing so.

   4) If the Board elects to utilize an advisory committee to provide input on the proposed policy, the Plan will include specific instructions regarding the composition of the committee as well as a specific written charge.

   5) When a proposed change to the Policy Manual is presented to the Board for approval, the proposal will be submitted to the Board together with the following information, which will be included in the Board Packet:

      I.  The purpose of the proposed change.

      II.  If the proposed policy is mandated by state or federal law, an explanation of the relevant law, including its full text if feasible. If the relevant law leaves room for the Superintendent or Board to exercise discretion, an explanation of what is mandated and what is discretionary.

      III.  If the superintendent believes the content of a proposed policy is within his or her delegated authority, but that board approval is required to satisfy a legal mandate, an express statement to this effect.

      IV.  An explanation of the process used to develop the proposed policy, including but not limited to the identity of the members of any committees or advisory groups that were consulted.

      V.  A brief summary of the choices reflected in the proposal and the issues considered by the Superintendent in developing the recommendation, including (A) a brief summary of any concerns that have been raised by stakeholders or the public, and (B) the Superintendent's response to those concerns.

      VI.  The Superintendent's recommendation.

### Policy 1.2: Meetings {#policy-1.2-meetings}

a) #### Regular Meetings {#policy-1.2.a-regular-meetings}

   At least one regular meeting will be held each month. The Board will set the time and place for each regular meeting for the entire calendar year at its January meeting. Unless otherwise noted, meetings will be held in the Board Room at the Central Office at Beacon (125 Electric Avenue).

b) #### Special Meetings {#policy-1.2.b-special-meetings}

   At the discretion of the Chair, a special meeting of the Board may be called in accordance with the requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act.

c) #### Executive Sessions (Closed Meetings) {#policy-1.2.c-executive_sessions}

   An executive session is a meeting that is closed to the public. The Board may meet in executive session for purposes enumerated in the Georgia Open Meetings Act, [O.C.G.A. § 50-14-04][ocga-50-14-4], provided the procedures set forth in that statute are followed, including specifically the following: (1) executive sessions may only be held to discuss topics specifically authorized by the Georgia Open Meetings Act; (2) the vote to convene an executive session must be taken in an open meeting; (3) each member attending an executive session will execute an affidavit confirming that these procedures were followed. Minutes will be kept but will not be available to the public.

d) #### Work Sessions {#policy-1.2.d-work-sessions}

   The Board may hold work sessions to address special topics. Work sessions are open meetings subject to all requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act. As a general rule, no vote or other official action will be taken at a work session unless specifically stated on the public notice. If a vote is anticipated, the meeting should be noticed as a "special meeting" rather than a work session.

e) #### Meeting Agendas and Packets {#policy-1.2.e-meeting-agendas}

   1) The Chair will set the agenda for each meeting in consultation with the Superintendent and other Board members. The Chair will work with the Superintendent to ensure meeting agendas follow the Board Work Plan.

   2) The Chair will strive to provide a draft of all meeting agendas to the entire Board and Superintendent before the meeting notice is published.

   3) Any Board member may request that an item be added to the agenda. Such requests should be presented to the Chair, with a copy to the entire board and Superintendent. When possible, such requests should be made at least two weeks (14 days) prior to the meeting. Subject to the requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act, the agenda for a meeting may also be amended by majority vote of the board in accordance with Roberts Rules of Order.

   4) The Superintendent will distribute meeting agendas and packets at least one week (7 calendar days) prior to the meeting. Board members will strive to ask substantive questions about the agenda prior to the meeting to give the Superintendent notice of the questions and time to prepare a response.

   5) The consent agenda will be used to secure the Board's approval of items the board is required to approve, but that are not controversial and do not require discussion. Examples include items for which the Board has delegated responsibility to the Superintendent, but which the Board is required to approve as a matter of state or federal law. Each item added to the consent agenda should clearly identify the action requested of the Board and the Superintendent's reasons for requesting Board approval rather than acting on his or her own authority. As provided in Roberts Rules of Order, any item on the consent agenda shall be removed from it upon request by any member.

f) #### Spotlights {#policy-1.2.f-spotlights}

   The Superintendent will identify and coordinate the Spotlight for each meeting. The Spotlight will be limited to 10 minutes except in rare cases approved by the Chair. It will be the Superintendent's responsibility to ensure that persons presenting the Spotlight are informed of this time limit and are prepared to honor it.

g) #### Public Input {#policy-1.2.g-public-input}

   1) Public Comment can be expressed by emailing, writing, or calling Board members, meeting with a Board member, or speaking during the "public comment" portion of a Board meeting. Emails should be directed to board@csdecatur.net. Such emails will be forwarded to all members of the Board, including the Superintendent.

   2) Individuals interested in speaking during Public Comment must sign­in at the meeting, prior to the commencement of Public Comment. Persons who fail to sign in may still be allowed to speak at the Chair's discretion, with the decision being made solely on the basis of the time already allocated to Public Comment and the time needed to complete the agenda.

   3) At the beginning of the public comment period, the Chair will determine the time limit for all speakers---generally from three to five minutes per speaker. The determination will be based on the number of persons wishing to speak and the time needed to complete the agenda.

   4) Persons requiring technical assistance or any other form of support can support from staff members present at the meeting.

   5) Persons speaking during public comment will not be permitted to "pool" time or "donate" unused time to other speakers. Any group consisting of three or more persons wishing to make a longer presentation or to utilize display technology may request permission to do so by contacting the Superintendent's office by 3 pm the day prior to the meeting. Such groups may be allocated additional time at the Chair's discretion. The members of any group availing itself of this procedures must still sign in prior to the commencement of the Public Comment period.

   6) Abusive language and personal attacks will not be permitted during the public comment period. At the Chair's discretion, persons violating this policy may be asked to step down. \[Don't' we have other restrictions---e.g., do not discuss personnel matters--- that should be noted here.\]

   7) When an issue arises that stimulates a high degree of community interest, the Board may schedule a Special Meeting or Work Session to solicit input following such procedures as the Board deems appropriate.

   8) Board members will not address persons presenting Public Comment or speak to the substance of any comments made, except to acknowledge them. Board members of the Superintendent may, however, ask questions for clarification. \[Should the policy say why?\]

### Policy 1.3: Officers {#policy-1.3-officers}

a) #### Officer Elections {#policy-1.3.a-officer-elections}

   The Board shall elect a Chair and Vice Chair at the regularly scheduled
board meeting in January of each year, through the following process:

   Any member wishing to stand for election for either office will make their interest known to all other members prior to the January meeting.

   At the January meeting, the Chair will cede the gavel to the Superintendent for purposes of the officer election.

   Superintendent will accept nominations for Chair. Any member may nominate his or herself for either position. No second is required. The vote will be taken by *signed* ballot immediately after the nominations have closed. The superintendent will then read the ballots, stating each member's vote to be recorded in the minutes. The same process will be used to elect the Vice Chair, with nominations being accepted after the new Chair has been elected.

   If there is a change in officers, the Superintendent will call a 5-minute recess and the Board members will rearrange their seating based on the outcome of the election. The Superintendent will return control of the meeting to the newly elected Chair.

b) #### Responsibilities {#policy-1.3.b-responsibilities}

   The primary role of the Chair is to preside at meetings and to develop meeting agendas in consultation with the Superintendent. The primary
role of the Vice Chair is to perform these functions in the Chair's absence. In the absence of the Vice Chair, the three remaining board members shall appoint one member to serve as temporary Chair.

   2) Act in his or her official capacity in any matter where he or she, his or her immediate family member, or a business organization in which he or she has an interest has a material financial interest that would reasonably be expected to impair his or her objectivity or independence of judgment. Compliance with [O.C.G.A. § 20-2-505][ocga-20-2-505] shall not constitute a violation of this subparagraph.

   3) Solicit or accept or knowingly allow his or her immediate family member or a business organization in which he or she has an interest to solicit or accept any gift, favor, loan, political contribution, service, promise of future employment, or other thing of value based upon an understanding that the gift, favor, loan, political contribution, service, promise of future employment, or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose of influencing that board member in the discharge of his or her official duties. This paragraph shall not apply to the solicitation or acceptance of contributions to the campaign of an announced candidate for elective public office if the local board of education member has no knowledge or reason to believe that the campaign contribution, if accepted, was given with the intent to influence the local board of education member in the discharge of his or her official duties. For purposes of this subparagraph, a gift, favor, loan, contribution, service, promise, or other thing of value shall not include the items contained in subparagraphs (a)(2)(A) through (a)(2)(J) of [O.C.G.A. § 16-10-2][ocga-16-10-2].
